# Hoornbeeck Rooster App

This is an app that displays a schedule like [roosterinfo.nl](http://roosterinfo.nl/)<br/>

Nothing of the schedules is owned by me, the app just uses the same API as the original app.

### Possibilities
- When the app is online it saves the schedule locally, so the schedule can be accessed offline
- Save multiple schedules of different classes, groups or teachers
- View the schedule for 10 days

## Made with Flutter
