# Hoornbeeck Rooster App

This is an app that displays a schedule like [roosterinfo.nl](http://roosterinfo.nl/)<br/>

Nothing of the schedules is owned by me, the app just uses the same API as the original app.

### Features
- When the app is online it saves the schedule locally, so the schedule can be accessed offline
- Save multiple schedules of different classes, groups or teachers
- View the schedule for 10 days

## Made with Flutter

For information about Flutter, view their online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

## Improvements
When I look back at this, there is much to improve. Lots of thing aren't really needed because there is an easier way to do it. Maybe I'll improve it in the future.
If you find something that could be improved, please add an Issue [here](https://github.com/ReindertKorver/Hoornbeeck-Rooster-app/issues).
